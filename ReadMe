This program is a webcrawler for the website https://portal.nosscr.org/iSamples/SharedContent/ContactManagement/Directory.aspx that scrapes the contact info of 1000 people off the site.
To do this I needed to be able to press the show all button to be able to have all 1000 peoples contact info in visible in the html. To accomplish this I used chrome driver and the Selenium library.
I also needed to parse through the html and use a for each loop to actually get everyones information which I would then put in a csv file. In order to accomplish this I used the library Jsoup.
If you are having issues getting it working please look at comments in the code they should help you out. Also ignore all csv files except out as I was just messing with them and out.csv is the expected outcome.
